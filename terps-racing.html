                        importantly the rear wing is what pushes down onto the rear tires when cornering allows for
                        greater entry and exit speeds which leads way to a faster car.</p>

                        goal was to improve upon the existing design for more downforce and less drag. This section will
                        showcase the design of the rear wing and its subsidiary components: endplates, major airfoil,
                        minor airfoils as well as the drag reduction system (DRS) and mounting system.</p>

                                drag. The top cutout is a vortex generator designed to pull the slower moving air from
                                the top side of the airfoils. This single section was one of the biggest improvements of
                                reducing drag. Finally the right most cutout serves a similar purpose for the air
                                traveling underneath the airfoils.</p>

                            <p>The major airfoil for the rear wing is a custom profile designed around the roll hoop and
                                brace directly in front. A main issue with oncoming airflow to the rear wing is that the
                                bottom section is often blocked by the driver's helmet. To solve this I designed a 3D
                                sketch to lift up the front section of the airfoil to peek above the headrest. Doing so
                                lead to a 8% gain in downforce alone.</p>

                    <p class="text-block mt-4">The minor airfoils of the rear wing consist of two MSHD airfoils and one
                        NACA 6412 airfoil. A majority of the downforce increase compared to the previous year's rear
                        wing was using the MSHD airfoil as well as increasing the chord length. The MSHD airfoils are
                        also set at a higher angle of attack which does increase drag, however the downforce benefit is
                        much higher. The NACA 6412 airfoil is simply to keep the oncoming airflow at the top of the rear
                        wing as laminar as possible, which as yield quite positive results. The exact downforce gain is
                        shown in the simulations section.</p>

                            <p>This video demonstrates how DRS will work on the rear wing. The main advantage is a 40%
                                reduced drag coefficient with the rear two minors being at a near zero angle of attack.
                                The four linkage system connects to the center of pressure of both the MSHD airfoils for
                                the least amount of resistance for rotation. The DRS will be powered by a stepper motor
                                which still needs to be finalized by the electrical subteam.</p>

                                fairly good look into what the final mounting system will look like. The swan neck was
                                chosen as it allows for the most amount of oncoming airflow while being rigid enough to
                                support the amount of downforce and drag generated. Additionally, there will be two

                                with only a 5% increase in drag allows for a lift to drag ratio of 2.61 compared to
                                2.17. In other words, this rear wing with the modified major, MSHD airfoils, and
                                reworked vortex generators is much more efficient compared to last year's model.</p>

                        .33 lbf (150 grams) of downforce at 20 mph. As I ran the simulation with the scaled rear wing,
                        we got .36 lbf (163 grams) of downforce​. Which led to a 91.67% accuracy to simulation, which

                            <p>The aerodynamics subteam at Terps Racing EV went to Detroit Michigan to test TREV 3 at
                                one of Ford's Wind Tunnels. This test was to see how our aerodynamic package reacts to
                                different velocities. The video shows our test at 96 kph or just under 60 mph. We saw
                                shaking and mild distortion among our manufactured carbon components, which means we
                                need to build them more rigidly.</p>

                            <p>In this video at Ford's wind tunnel facility we were using smoke flow to visualize the
                                vortexes coming off our front wing and the front left tire. This is an important area
                                for side pods since it shows a bunch of stagnant flow around ( which was also seen in
                                the simulation ).</p>

                            <p>This was a three point bend test for our body panels on TREV 4. We tested several panels
                                with varying levels of resin and different thicknesses of coremat at the Naval Academy's
                                Stress Testing Lab. This was done since our body panels in our previous car were getting
                                too thin in certain places. This test showed us that the recipe for panel #3 gave us the
                                best results for strength and weight.</p>

                            <p>This was a resin infusion test, which allows the resin to penetrate more deeply and
                                evenly into more complex molds. This test was done in preparation for our nose cone and
                                seat for our upcoming car. The same steps for setting a motel sheet, vacuum bag, gummy
                                tape, and vacuum are all the same however the difference is an infusion tube which
                                allows resin to be dispersed through the mold. The only issue with this is the set up is
                                slightly tricky and this test was only semi- successful.</p>
